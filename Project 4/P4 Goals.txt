Goal was to include images that change when hovered (image swap) and apply them to a bio.

Navigation buttons now needed to have an indication when you were hovering the button. the depth of the button now changes.

links included in footer to the other pages as well as the navbar.

I spent extra time on my graphics such as banners and custom media including small details such as items in my banner having a 3D layering effect.

This was not required, just something I was interested in accomplishing myself.
