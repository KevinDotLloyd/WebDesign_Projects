        <h3>Mochi the Dog</h3>
        <img src="Images/Mochi1.jpg" alt="mochi the dog">
        <p>
            Mochi is a 3 year old male Shiba Inu, and we have had him since he was a tiny puppy.
            <br>   
            He's very anti-social and doesn't like big events or going out in public, but is big on cuddling with family.
            <br>
            One of his favorite passtimes is to play ball in the yard, and he is very good at catching it after it bounces one time.
            <br>Side note: He's 100% a mommas boy.

        <h3>Trip the Cat</h3>
        <img src="Images/Trip1.jpg" alt="trip the cat with flower boquet">
        <p>
            Trip is a family rescue that we took in after my wife's grandma had passed away and he needed a home.
            <br>   
            He has always been a spoiled only child, so he has had some difficulties adjusting to having a bigger dog brother.
            <br>
            He'll get over it!

        <h3>Natsu, Miku, and Yuki the Ferrets</h3>
        <img src="Images/Natsu1.jpg" alt="natsu the ferret with dirt on nose">
        <br>
        <p>
            Natsu is our only male ferret, and consequently our biggest.
            <br>
            He loves to play by rolling around colorful plastic balls with bells inside. They're actually cat toys, but he loves it.
            <br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <img src="Images/Miku1.jpg" alt="miku the ferret in a blanket">
        <br>
        <p>
            Miku is Natu's sister and likes to play by hunting her toys, and carrying them to a hiding spot.
            <br>
            She especially loves tease toys that are on the end of a string, and will go crazy for a squeaker toy.
            <br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <img src="Images/Yuki1.jpg" alt="yuki the ferret in a toy tunnel">
        <p>
            Yuki is a rescue that found a home in us thanks to a close friend.
            <br>
            She was actually found outside in the middle of winter behind a restruant. She was so cold she ran up to a friend of ours and tried to go up their pantleg.
            <br>
            Fun fact: we named her Yuki which means Snow and she doesn't grow hair on the tip of her tail. We think that may have been because of frostbite.
            <br>
            Don't worry though, she's been living a healthy warm life with us for 3 years now. :)

        <h3>Peaches, Chickpea, and Pepper: our Chickens</h3>
        <img src="Images/Chickens1.jpg" alt="three chickens in a line with tailfeathers in air">
        <br>
        <p>
            My Wife and I have had backyard chickens for about 6 years now.
            <br>
            It is a small flock of 3, as that is the legal limit in the residental area where we live.
            <br>
            All of our chickens are girls, and we get plenty of eggs in the summer.
