                <p>
                    
                Mochi is our 3 Year old Shiba-Inu. <br><br>
                
                Mochi is an anxious puppy in social situations, and likes it best when he's cuddling with Mom on the couch, or playing Ball with Dad in the yard. <br><br>
            
                Despite being a medium dog, he somehow is able to take the majority of our king size bed.. We still love him anyway.

                <p> 
                Trip is a 14 year old Cat. Yep! We're not sure what breed he is. <br><br>
                
                His favorite thing is being away from Mochi. If Mochi gets too close to his personal space he will meow very loudly until he gets frustrated and removes himself from the situation. <br><br>

                By the way: during your videos I do not hear your cats in the background! You must have a good noise canceling microphone.

                <p>
                    
                    From left to right, we have Yuki, Miku, and Natsu. They are all about 5 years old and are named after Japanese words. <br><br>

                    Yuki means "Snow" <br>
