                    If you play games on your computer, this one is pretty self explanatory! <br><br>

                    Steam is a digital video game distribution service, and I like it more for the content available on it rather than the site itself. <br><br>

                    Steam has also released a Virtual Reality headset called the "Index" and even though VR games are currently small and niche I've been enjoying the journey and experience of games being developed for this new platform.

                <p>
                    Color Hunt is a color pallate picker website that I've grown fond of and even used to find the color pallate of this project. <br><br>

                    I love that you can find commonly loved pallates from users voting on them, and that they are diplayed in a ratio where you can get the feel of colors and how they would work together.

                <p>
                    Pluralsight is a tech skill development (which I'm sure you're familiar with due to your classes you host) that I was introduced to as a free benefit during my first tech job. <br><br>

                    I was able to use this site to learn many tech support and administrative skills, and even got to use it on my personal time to get some basic knowledge on Software Development platfroms like Swift, Java, and Python.
