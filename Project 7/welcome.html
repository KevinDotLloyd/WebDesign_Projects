        <h1> Welcome to "My Favorites" Project! </h1>

        <p>
            As requested, I will be taking you through a Home page (AKA the page you're on now), a repository of Links to some of my favorite sites, and an image Gallery of things I find interesting. <br><br>

            Please use the navigation bar above to browse through the site! You'll notice that "Home" is currently bordered in blue, because that is the indicator for the page you're currently on. <br><br>

            I hope you enjoy the site, and thanks for taking the time to grade this project today!
