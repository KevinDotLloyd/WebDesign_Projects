                <p>
                    There are many factors that led up to the Video Game Crash of 1983 (also known as the "Atari Shock"), but I will cover the top 3 contributing factors listed below...
                    <ul>
                        <li>&bull; Market Oversaturation</li>
                        <li>&bull; Loss of Publishing Control</li>
                        <li>&bull; No consumer interest</li>
                    </ul>

                    So, obviously we have games today? So what changed and how did the industry reclaim it's consumers? <br><br>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;"> A Modern Comparison to the 2015 Indie Game Boom</h3>

                <p>

                    Is history doomed to repeat itself again? <br><br>
                    
                    With the boom of Independent developers on the market today, the number of games on the market is at levels we have never seen before.<br><br>
                    
                    Just from 2015 to 2020 there were roughly 4x as many games released on the Steam market alone! <br><br>
