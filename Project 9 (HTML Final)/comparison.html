                    Is history doomed to repeat itself again? Personally, I think no.<br><br>
                    
                    With the boom of Independent developers on the market today, the number of games on the market is at levels we have never seen before.<br><br>
                    
                    Just from 2015 to 2020 there were roughly 4x as many games released on the Steam market alone! <br><br>

                    But to me, the key difference between now and 1983, is the speed, scale, and accessibility of how we share knowledge.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Power of Reviews</h3>

                <p>
                    Currently in 2022, there is 50,000+ games availavle on Steam, caused by the accessibility of game development platforms and the large number of Independent Developers.<br><br>
                    
                    So how is it that users know what games are enjoyable - and what games are "the worst games you can imagine"?
                    <br>(and trust me, they're out there)<br><br>

                    I'd say this is thanks to social platfroms such as YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, etc.. and even the in-app review system on Steam itself. No matter how obscure the game or how small the developer - you can always find an opinion on everything.<br><br>

                    In this way, games are almost vetted by the consumer (and journalist medias) and the information is easily accessible. Even in the wake of an oversaturation of games users know what games will be playable and enjoyable - or worth their time and money. <br><br>

                    Anyway, Thanks for taking the time to read and grade this, and if you'd like to go back to the index and and listen to the jam from Baloon Fight again, <a href="index.html">Click here!</a> <br><br>
