Assignment was to make a multi-page bio with a hompage, and 3 different sibjects of your choosing.

Photoshop Graphics included navigation bar buttons, and a unique banner for each page

Media was to be trimmed to a website resolution for small file sizes and quick media loading time

All media was either a photo taken by me, art drawn by me, or graphics made of my interests that I arranged in photoshop myself.
